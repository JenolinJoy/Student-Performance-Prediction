# Student Performance Prediction System

This project predicts whether a student will pass or fail based on attendance, internal marks, and assignment scores using machine learning (Logistic Regression) in Python.

## Tools
- Python
- Google Colab
- pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib

## How it works
1. Dataset creation (60 students with attendance, marks, and assignment scores)
2. Data preprocessing (convert Pass/Fail to numbers)
3. Model training using Logistic Regression
4. Prediction on new data
5. Accuracy evaluation
6. Graph visualization (Attendance vs Result)

## Files
- `Student_Performance_Prediction.ipynb` — Notebook containing the code
- `StudentDataset.csv` — Dataset used for training

## Outcome
- Achieved around 94.44% prediction accuracy
- Provides early identification of students who may need academic support
